Features of Block Chain:
a) Decentalized - No Centralized source or an entity to control.
b) Transparency & Flexibility - Everything On-Chain is visible to everyone.
c) Speed & Efficiency
d) Secutiry & Immutabiity - Block chain cannot be changed/altered/intact meaning it is secure.
e) Removal of Counter party risk - e.g. insurance company- They resist to pay money on time.
f) Trust minimized agreements
g) Hybrid Smart Contracts combine On-chain and Of-chain.
Metamask - Ethereum wallet (have used this for learning purpose). Learnt how the wallet looks with dummy ETH :D. Created an account.
Etherscan - Portal to view transaction using account address.
Rinkeby Authenticated Faucet - To add ETH to Wallet for a specific account.
I will be using Kovan and Rinkeby test nets. 
Faucet : Is an application that give us free test tokens, like free test Rinkeby Ethereum.
Block Explorer : An application that allows us to view transactions that happens on a Block chain.
Transaction Details consist of following details:
a) Transaction Hash : Unique key to identify transactions
b) Status : Success/Fail
c) Block : Block Number
d) Time Stamp : Created on
e) From : Address of an account from which amount is sent
f) To : Address of an account of Receiver 
g) Transaction fees
GAS - Gas is a unit of computational measure. The more computation a transaction uses the more "Gas" needs to be paid.
Every transaction that happens on-chain pays a "Gas Fee" to node operators.
The amount of "Gas" used and how much you pay depends upon how "Computationally expensive" your transaction is.
Sending ETH to 1 address would be cheaper than sending ETH to 1000 addresses.
