Ethereum - Ethereum is a technology that's home to digital money, global payments, and applications.
Smart Contracts allow agreements without Centralized Intermediaries.
Smart Contracts are self-executing sets of instructions without involvement of 3rd Party.
Smart Contracts are written in code.
Smart Contracts need real world data.
Oracles are devices that bring data into block chain and execute external computations.
Oracles and SCs are decentralized applications.
For On-Chain logic will be decentralized on Block Chains.
Of-Chain are the external application that hold real world data and need to implement Block chain. E.g. ERP system, Logistic systems.
Combining Of-Chain and On-Chain components is called as Hybrid Smart contracts.
Chainlink - Chainlink allows for unlimited smart contract customization. Chainlink is most popular used decentralized oracle platform.
Chainlink provide data and external computation to Smart Contracts.
Dapp = Smart Contract = Decentralized application.
Ethereum is the most used Block Chain/Smart Contract protocol/Smart Contract Platform.
Bitcoin is the first application to take Block chain Mainstream.
Bitcoin is like a digital gold.
