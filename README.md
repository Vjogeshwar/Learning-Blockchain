# Lesson 1: Creating Smart contract - Simple Storage
## Concepts Learnt
### I have used [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) tool for creating Smart contracts
## ‚á® Day 6 Learning
### Basic Solidity
- Versioning
- Compiling
- Contract Declaration
- [Types & Declaring Variables](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/types.html)
  - `uint256`, `int256`, `bool`, `string`, `address`, `bytes32`
- Default Initializations
- Comments
- Functions
- Deploying a Contract
- Calling a public state-changing Function
- Scope
- View & Pure Functions
- Structs
- Intro to Storage
- Arrays - Dynamic & Fixed sized
- Compiler Errors and Warnings
- Memory
- Mappings
- SPDX License
- JavaScript Virtual Machine

#### Below is the code hyperlink for my first Smart contract in Solidity. This code creates a list of people storing their name and favorite number.
- üíª _Code_: [Smartcontract To Add Person Name and Favourite Number To The People List](https://github.com/Vjogeshwar/People_List_SmartContract)

## ‚á® Day 7 Learning
### Deploying to a "Live" network
- A testnet or mainnet
- [Find a faucet here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/link-token-contracts/#rinkeby)
- Connecting Metamask
- Interacting with Deployed Contracts
- The EVM

# Lesson 2: [Storage Factory]
## ‚á® Day 8 Learning
### Inheritance, Factory Pattern, and Interacting with External Contracts
- Factory Pattern
- Imports
- Deploy a Contract From a Contract
- Interact With a Deployed Contract

#### There are 2 ways to use the different contract or an external contract within the contract.
      - Import 
      - Inheritance (Is external contract)
- Following is the code snippet depicting "Import"
```
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

    pragma solidity  ^0.6.0;


    //We will be calling a Simple_Storage_VJ contract from this contract. We need to tell Storage Factory contract to deploy contract from here
    //Import is same as copy paste of code of smartcontract that is called.

    import "./Simple_Storage_VJ.sol";
    //This is the way to import any type of file or a contract.

    contract StorageFactory {
```
- üíª Code: [Calling a Contract from another contract using Import](https://github.com/Vjogeshwar/Inheritance_calling_contract/blob/main/contracts/StorageFactory_VJ.sol)

- Following is the code snippet depicting "Inheritance", in thes method we will have acces to all the methods and variable of called contract.
```
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

    pragma solidity  ^0.6.0;


    //We will be calling a Simple_Storage_VJ contract from this contract. We need to tell Storage Factory contract to deploy contract from here
    //Import is same as copy paste of code of smartcontract that is called.

    import "./Simple_Storage_VJ.sol";
    //This is the way to import any type of file or a contract.


    contract StorageFactory is SimpleStorage { 
    //Ineheritace, now we will have all variables and fuctions available directly inside StorageFactory
    //Deploy a contract from a contract
    
```
- üíª Code: [Calling a Contract from another contract using Inheritance](https://github.com/Vjogeshwar/Inheritance_calling_contract/blob/main/contracts/StorageFactory_VJ.sol)

# Lesson 3: Fund Me
## ‚á® Day 9 Learning
üíª Code: https://github.com/Vjogeshwar/Inheritance_calling_contract
### Payable, msg.sender, msg.value, Units of Measure
- Payable - If the function is made payable this means it is used for transferring funds.
- [Wei/Gwei/Eth Converter](https://eth-converter.com/)
- msg.sender is the sender account or the account which will send the funds 
- msg.value is the ETH amount that will be transferred.
```
    function fund() public payable {
        //With minimumUSD we are putting a restriction on the minimum transaction value of 
        // $50
        uint256 minimumUSD = 50 * 10 ** 18; 
        //1gwei < $50
        require(getConversionRate(msg.value) >= minimumUSD, "You need to spend more ETH!");
        //What the ETH -> USD conversion rete
        addressToAmountFunded[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        funders.push(msg.sender); //Push the current funder to the funder array.
    }
```
## ‚á® Day 10 Learning
### Chainlink Oracles
We will use following for the new smartcontract that will be created.
- [data.chain.link](https://data.chain.link/)
- Getting External Data with Chainlink Oracles
  - [Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/)
  - [Getting Price Information](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price/)
### Importing from NPM and Advanced Solidity
We get following mathematical functions to be used in our contract by importing interfaces(like contracts) from chainlink 
- Decimals/Floating Point Numbers in Solidity
- latestRoundData
- Importing from NPM  in Remix
- Interfaces
  - Introduction to ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces)
- [Getting Price Feed Addresses](https://docs.chain.link/docs/reference-contracts/)
```
    import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";
    import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/vendor/SafeMathChainlink.sol";
```

- Matching Units (Continued)
- SafeMath & Integer Overflow
  - using keyword
  - [Libraries](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/contracts.html#libraries)
  - SafeMath PSA
```
  contract FundMe {
    using SafeMathChainlink for uint256; //This will prevent overflow issues with uint256 data type value storage
    
    function getPrice() public view returns(uint256){
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0xD0AAAb485DbEc71BaE70c4c5Ac7Ea18F5B0d00C2);
        (,int256 answer,,,) = priceFeed.latestRoundData(); //Tuple definition
         return uint256(answer * 10000000000);
    }
```
